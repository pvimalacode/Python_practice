I order this and found out my batter percentage was 86%. I thought they tested for faults and repaired them. Overall the phone is good and in very good condition. But if you are buying this as renewed from amazon make sure to check the price in apple's website bcuz apple is selling it for more $50 for a new one and if you have a old iphone like 6s which i did you could get it by replace for less than $560.
It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it
Excellent shape, looks brand new and battery health is at 100%. Came perfectly padded with charging cord and wall charger. This was a great buy, doesn’t seem “renewed” at all, appears new.
So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it’s definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I’ll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT.
